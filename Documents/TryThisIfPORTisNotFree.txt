Your output shows that process **PID 8824** is still using port **5173**. You need to terminate it. Here's what to do next:

### **Kill the Process Using Port 5173**
Run the following command in **Command Prompt (as Administrator)**:
```sh
taskkill /PID 8824 /F
```
This will forcefully stop the process running on port 5173.

### **Verify if the Port is Free**
After running the command, check if the port is still in use:
```sh
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
```
If nothing shows up, the port is free, and you can restart your React app.

### **If the Issue Persists**
1. **Restart your computer** â€“ sometimes processes get stuck.
2. **Use a different port manually** â€“ run:
   ```sh
   vite --port 3000
   ```
   This will start Vite on port 3000 instead of 5173.
3. **Check if a background process (like Vite or another development tool) is running** by opening **Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)** and ending any process related to Node.js, Vite, or React.
